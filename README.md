# Marco D'Ercole - 1874366 - Homework 1 
I am Marco, i did my bachelor degree in Statistics in Sapienza (Scienze Statistiche: statica, economia, finanza e assicurazioni).
I am excited to begin this new chapther of my life in Data Science course. 

This homework was sometimes easy, sometimes hard. i liked it a lot because i could improve my skills. In the previous university i did just one exam with Python so
it has been important for me to summarize discuss with my collegues. I am happy of my work and i hope i will improve in the next months!

In the repository it is possible to find the document Gitignore Python, and MIT License how asked in the instruction.
There is the file Homework with all the codes in Jupyter Notebook and in the end the file with the PDF.
